# Bengaluru House Price Prediction using Ridge Regression

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Bengaluru based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other property-related attributes. Ridge Regression, a regularized linear regression model, is used to reduce overfitting by applying a penalty on large coefficients, ensuring better generalization for predicting house prices.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
A real-estate dataset was collected, containing details about various properties in Bengaluru, including features like the area, number of rooms, amenities, and location.

### Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features for better model performance.

### Modeling with Ridge Regression
A Ridge Regression model was trained on the processed data, applying L2 regularization to the linear regression model to avoid overfitting and enhance generalization.

### Model Evaluation
The model achieved an accuracy of 82%, with performance evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ², demonstrating the effectiveness of Ridge Regression in predicting house prices accurately.

## Key Results
- The model achieved an **82% accuracy** in predicting house prices, indicating good generalization and performance.
- Ridge regularization improved the stability of the model by controlling the complexity and reducing overfitting.
